# To-Do List Manager

The To-Do List Manager is a simple web application built with Python and Flask that allows users to manage their to-do list. The app enables users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed, with the tasks being stored in a SQLite database. This open source app is easily customizable and extensible, making it a great starting point for developing more complex task management systems.
